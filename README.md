# Automatic-Music-Generation-using-Machine-Learning
The purpose of this project is to generate a melodic line in the style of a jazz improvisation using machine learning techniques. 

A traditional jazz tune has a standard structure: it is composed by a melody, called “theme”, which is usually played at the beginning and at the end of the tune, a “chord progression”, which sets the harmony of the song, and by a series of improvisations by the solo instrumentalists, which compose melodic lines in the moment of the improvisation, taking into account the harmony and the rhythm of the song. 

The goal of the developed model should be, therefore, to generate a melodic line starting from a “jazz standard” structure, composed by a “theme” (a melody) and a “harmonic progression” (a series of chords); these information will be the input of the model. The output will be a generated melodic line with style depending on the data used to train the model. 

As the project concerns symbolic music generation, the dataset will be composed of jazz improvisation transcriptions in .midi format.
